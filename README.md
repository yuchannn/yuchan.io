# My Little Corner of the Internet ðŸŒ±

Hey there! Welcome to the source code of my personal website. This is where I'm documenting my journey through life, sharing my thoughts, and experimenting with web technologies I find interesting.

## What's This About?

This is more than just a portfolio - it's my digital garden where I'm growing my thoughts and experiences. From my journey as a student at CMU to my adventures in co-founding startups, I'm trying to capture it all here. The blog section is where I dump my random thoughts and musings (which I hope will become more structured over time!).

## Why This Exists

I believe in building in public and sharing experiences. While LinkedIn tells my professional story, this space is more personal - it's where I can be myself, share my quirky obsessions, talk about my weird health experiments, and document my journey of continuous self-improvement.
