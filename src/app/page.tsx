            <p>
              My name is Yuchan, and I&apos;m a M.S. student studying Electrical and Computer Engineering
              at Carnegie Mellon University. I was born in Chicago, grew up in Taiwan, and moved
              to Pittsburgh for college. Even though I am still currently living in Pittsburgh, me and 
              my friend Neelansh Kaabra co-founded our startup <a href="https://www.creditsea.com" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CreditSea</a> that is based out in India.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              I have a deep passion for engineering, particularly software. 
              I think EECS is truly as close as we can get to modern day magic. 
              Just imagine the level of engineering that made it possible for you (a stranger) to view this little about me website on your phone. 
              From tinkering around with little web projects, to eventually writing my own C compiler from scratch in Rust, 
              I&apos;ve tried my very best to learn everything I can about computers and I am truly enjoying this seemingly endless journey. 
              Glad that you&apos;re following right along.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            Outside of work, I live with the purpose of challenging myself to improve in any way I can
            (but that doesn&apos;t mean I don&apos;t try to have fun). In a way, I fantasize about being the
            main character in my own life. You know, those animes where after a gruelling 10 season
            grind, the protagonists unlocks some sort of over-powered superpower that turns them into some sort of 
            superhero among the normal people. While not a perfect analogy, I believe the really amazing things in life
            can only be achieved by consistently working hard on yourself for a very long time -- rather than things that result from
            a singular moment of genius. The discipline that you exhibit over time will give you a superpower that others cannot simply
            achieve in a day.

            I am pretty basic in many of my pursuits. I hit the gym, play the piano, and (try to) cook, just like pretty much any other guy in his twenties.
            That isn't to say I don't have my little peculiarities either! In fact, I have a quite lot of little quirks... I take a shot of olive oil every morning. I 
            am (perhaps) overly-concerned about health that I consume inordinate amounts of supplements. In a weird way, I treat my body like a machine.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed">
            I am a very big fan of attaching metrics to my life -- almost in an obsessive manner. I measure how much I sleep with a smart bed and my Oura Ring,
            I get regular blood work done to make sure my body is working the way it should, and I count the amount of calories I eat every single day.
